rly checks if it can only be accessed by wheel group and sets caller's uid to 0.

rly replaces the most common reason for using sudo, while at the same time being
much simpler, reducing the general security risk to the system. unlike sudo, rly
doesn't pretend that the caller's account is any more secure than root, so there
is never a need for a password. rly only escalates to root, if you want to allow
user to run commands as though they were another non-root user you can use doas.

rly is based on chiark-really, made by Ian Jackson <ian@chiark.greenend.org.uk>.
